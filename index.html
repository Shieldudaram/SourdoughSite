        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>10.93oz/310 g of water</li>
          <li>7.05oz/200 g of starter</li>
          <li>2 teaspoons/6g/.21oz of salt</li>
          <li>14.11oz/400 g all-purpose flour</li>
          <li>1.76oz/50 g wheat flour</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Book 1: The Starter</h3>
        <h4>Chapter 1: Creation</h4>
        <p>We have a starter so I’m skipping this for now.</p>

        <h4>Chapter 2: Maintenance</h4>
        <p>Ideally the sourdough starter should be fed daily. At the same time each day. It should help the growing
          yeast as it is a living creature. For maintaining it, feed it a 1:1:1 ratio of starter: flour: water, use King
          Arthur’s whole wheat flour and filtered water for the best results.</p>

        <h4>Chapter 3: The Feed Before</h4>
        <p>Before baking, feed the starter a 1:5:5 or 1:10:10 ratio of starter: flour: water. This will give the yeast
          more material to consume, making it more active before baking. Note that it will likely also take more time to
          rise enough to be ready for use.</p>

        <h4>Chapter 4: Finalé</h4>
        <p>Once the starter is just over double in size, it should be ready for use. It should be relatively airy and
          have a dome-shaped top. If it’s sunken in the middle, it may have been too long. A good test is a float test:
          if a spoonful of sourdough floats in a cup of warm water, it's ready to use.</p>

        <h4>Chapter 5: Tips and Tricks</h4>
        <p>The room temperature will affect how quickly the starter rises; the warmer the room, the quicker it will
          rise.</p>

        <h4>Chapter 6: Storage</h4>
        <p>Ours just stays on the counter, but I could write a spot about it going in the fridge.</p>

        <h4>Chapter 7: Discard</h4>
        <p>Mix 10.93oz/310 g of water, 7.05oz/200 g of starter, 2 teaspoons/6g/.21oz of salt, 14.11oz/400 g all-purpose
          flour, and 1.76oz/50 g wheat flour.</p>
        <p>Mix with a spoon until shaggy, then use hands. Let sit in a warm place for 30 minutes, then perform stretch
          and folds a few times over the next few hours (4 times over two hours then rest one hour).</p>
        <p>Flour dough and place it in a round banneton, shape it, and let it rest covered for an hour and a half.
          Preheat the oven to 500°F with a Dutch oven inside. Transfer the dough to the Dutch oven lined with parchment
          paper and semolina flour, set the temp to 485°F, and cook for 18/25 minutes. Remove the lid and cook for an
          additional 25/18 minutes at 465°F or 450°F for 30 minutes covered and then 15 uncovered.</p>
